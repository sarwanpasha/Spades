                SPADES has given me a family at LUMS and as any family would, it has always taught me how to be a better version of myself. It has taught me the true meaning of the word "team" and has always compelled me to challenge myself.

                  Our failures define us more than our successes! I believe it gives us something much more than what success can. Perhaps, it challenges our very own beliefs and ideologies; makes us stop in our tracks to re-evaluate and proceed accordingly.

                 I have been part of SPADES even before I was a part of SPADES. Paradox arises, cool right? But all I truly mean is that my journey with SPADES started with PSIFI, as a participant, then a volunteer, an event head and now finally as the General Secretary.

                 From friendships to professional experience, SPADES has given me everything that defines my experiences at LUMS. The society has made me what I am. It has taught me to collaborate, to lead and to celebrate failure.

                I remember my freshmen days all too vividly, the glorious clutter of the innumerable societies at LUMS and their back-to-back captivating orientations. Decisions, decisions. Amidst all the excitement and confusion there was something about SPADES that stood out for me; it instantly felt like home.
