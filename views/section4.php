							<h4>DIAGNOSIS DILEMMA</h4>
							<p>We don't expect any prior knowledge of biology. Every round is designed to provide equal playing field to people from all backgrounds
Crisis Scenario:
Round 1 combines action, rush, pressure, and panicked patients! Each team will be presented with a crisis scenario and each one of you will assume the role of paramedics. With limited time and resources, you will be required to provide first aid.
Making it more exciting, for the first time, round 1 will now feature a theme as well!
Clinical Action:
Participants would be working as doctors but this time around there won’t be an emergency situation. Instead there would be a hospital scenario where you would be examining a patient verbally. The patient would be suffering from a disease and you are required to diagnose that disease.
Bonus Round:
To add to the spice, bonus round will offer short exciting activities. What fun would it be, if we just revealed everything? Stay Tuned!
Surgical Expertise:
Ever wanted to wear an overall and hold those forceps? Well, now is your chance! This round involves operating a dummy and successfully plucking out its tumors without damaging the organs! For every damaged organ, you get to lose marks. It's a test of your precision and nerves.

							<h4>RGM</h4>
							<p>Did you ever lay down a mouse trap and find the slice of cheese missing afterwards? Did it ever occur to you that you needed to be smart enough to design a much more complicated trap? Like Tom, from the classic TV cartoon series, Tom and Jerry, used to make whenever he wanted to trap Jerry? 'The better mouse trap', as Tom called it, was in fact a Rube Goldberg Machine (RGM) composed of the simple things available at a house. A Rube Goldberg Machine, as you must have guessed by now, is a machine that uses a convoluted series of events to accomplish a simple task at the end. PsiFi’s RGM is an event that is looking for all you clever and innovative Tom's out there to grab your A-game and come forth to innovatively and masterfully exercise your brains to produce an RGM that will have our minds blown away!</p>

It won’t just challenge your mental abilities but will take your mind to limits that you didn’t knew existed. We will be dealing with cryptography, quick problem solving, analytical reasoning, critical thinking and some other jargon that might sound complicated but is very simple and fun in practice.

Wouldn’t it be terrific to hunt the missing treasure, find the clue to the next level, and gather all the missing pieces of the puzzles or to simply unlock the Sherlock in yourself. Well if you have the mind that can do it all then TechWars is the right option for you!

							<h4>Science Crime Busters</h4>
							<p>
Science Crime Busters is an event which allows each delegate to release their inner Sherlock and do what is necessary to solve a heinous crime. The delegates shall have the role of detectives and will be asked to help the police department solve a murder case. The story will pan out over the course of time, during which the delegates will be given clues, puzzles and tasks; each of which will help bring them a step closer to solving the murder. They will be asked to examine crime scenes, find clues, conduct interrogations, decrypt codes, carry out lab tests and catch the killer before he (or she) strikes again!
